Pros of Raw SQL-
Compatable with any backend
    (Java, C++, Python)
Portable, easier to maintain.
No need to install, manage, and
    learn ORM.
Helps new contributors get up to 
    speed faster.
Database design is not influenced 
    by ORM.

Pros of ORM- 
Lower barrier to entry/ more convienent
to use boy someone with more experience
    in a backend language/ unfamiliar with SQL.
Increases development speed, great for rapid prototyping.
Provides consistent, object-oriented structure and 
    naming patterns.
Usually fewer lines of code to write.
May provide integration with migrations tool that
    allows you to write in python.

Raw SQL- 
Low level direct queries
Fewer tools to leanr and manage
Better for complex queries
Functional approach

ORM-
Higher level abstractions
Convenient
Better for simple queries
Object oriented approach

How to choose-
Resources (time, number of developers)
Scale (load, complexity)
Expertise with SQL vs. backend language

ORMs provide a framework for working with SQL
ORM layers python or another language on top of the
    sql queries being executed.
Only some backends use an ORM.
Even when using an ORM, its still important to 
    know SQL.
You must learn SQL to use relational databases.
